# US-Demographic-Data-Vizualization
A multi-filter [Tableau dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/USCensusDemographicDataVisualization_16658782994120/Story1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) that displays state-level data on poverty, income, and population.

# Project Overview
In this project, I used Tableau to reveal insights from US Census Demographic Data. This data comes from a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muonneutrino/us-census-demographic-data) dataset and includes the census data for all counties in 2015.

# Outcomes Computed
I've created a dynamic dashboard to provide the following information:
- distribution of population
- top states by poverty rate and income
- relationship between poverty and income
